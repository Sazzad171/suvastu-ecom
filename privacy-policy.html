              </p>

              <h4>SECURITY POLICY</h4>
              <h5>Access Limitations</h5>
              <p>
                We limit access to the personal information we have about you to those employees who have a legitimate business need to access such information. In keeping with industry standards and practices, we maintain appropriate physical, electronic and procedural safeguards and controls to protect your information. The Site is built upon a secure infrastructure with multiple layers of protection, and we use industry-standard encryption technologies to safeguard your information.
                <br><br>
                Users are required to identify and authenticate themselves prior to accessing sensitive portions of the Site. Generally, identification and authentication takes place through the use of your username and a password and/or while logging in with one of our technical support staff.
                
              </p>

              <h5>Notifications of Security Systems Breach</h5>
              <p>
                If we learn of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may also post a notice on or through the Site in the event of a security breach. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.
              </p>

              <h5>Take Precautionary Measures</h5>
              <p>
                You can take several precautions to protect the security of your computer and personal information. For instance, you can use a well-chosen password and restrict access to your email account. You can also install and regularly update antivirus and firewall software to protect your computer from external attacks by malicious users. When you are finished with a session on the Site, be sure that you log out and close the browser window.
                <br>
                You should also be aware of fraudulent attempts to gain access to your account information through “phishing,” whereby scammers try to bring unsuspecting people to a website by using a genuine-looking email purporting to be from a legitimate company. Sometimes, either in the email itself or on this fake site,scammers will ask for login information to gain access to people’s accounts and withdraw their money.
                <br>
                OAZO HOLDINGS will never send you an email asking you for your login information. In general,you can protect yourself against phishing by never providing personal or login information via a link contained in an email and instead directly visit the Site. You might also make it a habit to check the URL of a website to be sure that it begins with the correct domain. In the case of OAZO HOLDINGS, you should always ensure the URL begins with https://www.oazoholdings.com.
              </p>

              </p>
